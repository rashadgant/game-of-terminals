# Game of Terminals

> A Game-of-Thrones-themed Bash exercise.

## Set Up

If you're on MacOS, go ahead and open up the Terminal application (found inside Applications > Utilities).

If you're on Windows, you'll need to install a Terminal. The easy way is to install an application called Git Bash which you can download [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). A better but more difficult to set up option is to set up [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). WSL2 is my personal preference although both options will work fine.

## Instructions

You won't need to submit anything on GitHub for this assignment so don't worry about forking this repository.

#### Do all of the following steps using the command line

1. Navigate to your `workspace` directory. If you don't have a `workspace` directory, go ahead and create one (your home folder is a good location).
1. Inside `workspace`, create a new folder called `game-of-thrones`
2. Navigate into this new directory and create the following new folders
    * `winterfell`
    * `kings-landing`
    * `the-wall`
    * `the-narrow-sea`
1. Inside `winterfell`, create the following files
    * `jon-snow.md`
    * `sansa.md`
    * `arya.md`
    * `ned.md`
1. Inside `kings-landing`, create the following files
    * `cersei.md`
    * `tyrion.md`
    * `jaime.md`
1. Inside `the-narrow-sea`, create the following directory
    * `daenerys`
1. Finally, create the following three files inside the `daenerys` folder
    * `dragon-1.md`
    * `dragon-2.md`
    * `dragon-3.md`

#### Now let’s fight for **iron throne**
